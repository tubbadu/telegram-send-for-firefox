# telegram-send-for-firefox

Add a firefox context menu to send page links to telegram using telegram-send

Note: this is only tested for linux systems (Fedora37, but should work with other linux OS too); Windows and MacOS won't probably work. However, it should be easy to make this work in Windows and MacOS too, so if you'd like fork the project and send the pull request!

## Installation:

* install and configure [Telegram-send](https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/), making sure it works fine

* Install [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/send-urls-with-telegram-send/)

* download the native host files ([json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tubbadu/telegram-send-for-firefox/main/firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json) and [py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tubbadu/telegram-send-for-firefox/main/firefox-telegram-send.py))

* in the `firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json` file replace `$USER`with your username

* give the `firefox-telegram-send.py` file execution permission

* move the native host files to `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`

* right-click on any link, image or in the page and send the URL to telegram!

to install the native host you can run in a terminal:

```bash
# download native host files
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tubbadu/telegram-send-for-firefox/main/firefox-telegram-send.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tubbadu/telegram-send-for-firefox/main/firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json


# replace $USER with your username in the json file
sed -i "s+\$USER+$USER+g" firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json

# give executable permission to the py file
chmod +x firefox-telegram-send.py

# move the files to the right location
mv firefox-telegram-send.py /home/$USER/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/firefox-telegram-send.py
mv firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json /home/$USER/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json
```

to remove the native host just delete the py and json files:

```bash
rm $HOME/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/firefox_telegram_send_nativeHost.json
rm $HOME/tubbadu/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/firefox-telegram-send.py
```
